## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

### What I Did

* I created 3 pages: index.html. portfolio.html, and contact.html.

* Every page has a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images. 

* Index.html uses Bootstrap CSS & HTML with a responsive layout containing responsive images. On a 'xs' screen, the content takes up the entire screen. There are some margins on the left and right of the screen on 'sm' and larger screens. The responsive images in the sidebar will shift to the bottom as the screen gets smaller. 

* Portfolio.html uses Bootstrap CSS & HTML with a responsive layout containing responsive images. On a 'xs' screen, the content takes up the entire screen. There are some margins on the left and right of the screen on 'sm' and larger screens. The responsive images in the main container and on the sidebar will shift lower as the screen gets smaller.   

* Contact.html uses Bootstrap CSS & HTML with a responsive layout containing a Bootstrap card, contact form, and responsive images. On a 'xs' screen, the content takes up the entire screen. There are some margins on the left and right of the screen on 'sm' and larger screens. The responsive images in the sidebar will shift to the bottom as the screen gets smaller.
